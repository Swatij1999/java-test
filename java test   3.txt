1] Your task is to make two functions(max and min or maximum and minimum depending on the languge)
   that recive a list of integers as input and return the largest and lowest number in that list,respectively.
   input:[45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454]

    output:min:->23
    max:->900

---->  pubic class program1{
       public static void main(String[]args){
         int a[]={45,333,76,29,900,23,474,654,29,454};
         int temp;
           for (int i =0; i<a.length;j++){
             for(int j =i+1; j<a.length;j++){
                 if(a[i]>a[j]){
                   temp=a[i];
                   a[i]=a[i];
                   a[j]=atemp;
                }
          }
     }
         System.out.println("max num"+"  "+a[a.length-1]);
         System.out.println("min num"+"  "+a[0]);
      }
  }



2] Timmy & Sarah think they are in love,but around where they live,they will only know onece
   they pick a flower each.if one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number
   of petals it means they are in love.

   write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return
   if they are in love and false if they aren't.

----> public class program2 {
       public static void main(String[]args){
          int petalNum;
          Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
          int petalNumber=sc.nextInt();

            if(petalNumber %2==0){
               System.out.println("Both are in love");
           }
             else{
            System.out.println("Both are not in love");
          }
    }
}


3] What are the generalized and specialized classes in java?
---> generalization: these are refered as superclass
                      subclasses can aqured a properties by superclasses inplicitely

     specialization:  these are refered as subclass
                      subclsses can aqured a properties by superclasses explicitely


4] a) don't want my class to be inherited by any other class.What should i do?
---> make my  super class methods as private,this class and methods should not be inherite by other class.

   b) Can you give a few examples of final classes defined in java API?
   c) What are some alternatives to inheritance?


5] Which Sorted collection have you used?
--->  This comes very late,but there is a class in the JDK just for purpose of having a sorted list.
       It is named( somewhat out of order with the other sorted*interfaces) "java.util.priorityQueue"
       It can sorteither Comparable <?>s or using a comparator.


6] what is the difference between LinkedList nd ArrayList in java?
---> ArrayList: internally call array 
                arrayList contain listIterator
                reading operation is easy
                writing operation is slow or difficult.

    LinkedList: internally call node
                reading operation is slow
                writing operation is easy

7] What is the difference between ListIterator and iterator in java?

----> Iterator: it  is used to access the element forward direction
                it is avilable in collection

      ListIterator: it is used to access the element both in forward and backward irection
                    it is special type avilable in listerator

8] What is the covariant method overriding in java?
9] What is memory leakage i java?
10] Explain static polymophism an dynamic polymorphism?

---->   static polymorphism:  refered as completime polymorphism
                              achived by method overloading
                              method overloading means declaration of method more than once with a same within a  same class  but diffrent in parameterlist.

        dynamic polymorphism: refered as runtime polymorphism
                              achived by method overloading
                              method overriding means method signature must be same but diffrent in implimentaion.


11] Hema created a class called personallnformation and she want to give security for the properties how can she achive.

----> hema make a class personal information variable or proparte by private using encapsulation we can achive the security.
